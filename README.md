# Shipment status change app
**This is my first Fullstack Fiori application made it from scratch.**

- The backend stuff was made in SAP system, using ABAP programming language I code the RFC's where I manage to do the CRUD operations also I created the OData service and publish it, to be able to call it in the frontend.

- The frontend was all made in Javascript, using the official SAPUI5 libraries.

## Functionality 

- It's a simple app where the carrier looks for his shipment and updates his status. The app retrieves the data from the backend and exposes it to the carrier, then he can update the status of the shipment.

- It easy but involves a lot of validations(done in the backend and frontend) due to business rules.
